# Seattle-Airbnb-analysis
The data we will use is called “Seattle Airbnb Open Data” from Kaggle. The data is divided into 3 data sets, describing 
the different available ​Airbnb listings​ across Seattle since 2008. In them, we see the different ​prices​ 
for the listings, how these may change over different times of the year, as well as ​customer reviews and descriptions​ 
of the different listings. Additionally, there is also supplementary data regarding the neighborhoods in which they are 
located, such as the availability of public transport near the listings, landmarks to sightsee and experience close by, 
as well as public information of the hosts for each listing.

Project Outline & Goals
1. Clustering of airbnbs in the city
○ Geographical location of Airbnbs
○ Where are the most popular destinations?
2. Checking the “vibe” of different neighborhoods
○ Keyword extraction from neighborhood overviews
○ Popular topics in reviews per neighborhood
3. How do prices change over the year? By neighborhood?
○ Finding average price changes
